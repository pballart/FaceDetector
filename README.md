# FaceDetector
## Face detection using a Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifier

University project to start working with OpenCV

It uses OpenCV 2.4.9 installed via Cocoapods and is fully compatible with Xcode 6.3 and iOS 8.3.

The code is in a very early stage and bad organized because it is a small University homework and I don't have time for clearing the project but it works!

Basically, you open the app and you can switch between back and front camera. When it detects a face, it draws a red rectangle over the face.

Feel free to use the code and improve it if you want!
